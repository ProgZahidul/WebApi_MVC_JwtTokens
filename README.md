JWT Token Generation and Master Details CRUD Operations with MVC API
This GitHub repository provides a simple solution for implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and managing master details through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Features
1. JWT Token Generation: Securely generate JWT tokens for authentication purposes, ensuring a robust and reliable method for securing your API endpoints.

2. Master Details CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD operations to manage master details efficiently. Create, read, update, and delete records seamlessly.

3. MVC API Architecture: Organize your code using the MVC architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and facilitating maintainability.

Technologies Used
a. ASP.NET MVC: Utilize the power of ASP.NET MVC for building a structured and modular web application.

b. Entity Framework: Leverage Entity Framework for database operations, providing a seamless and efficient data access layer.

c. JWT Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication to secure your API and control access to resources.

Usage with Postman
1. Open Postman and import the provided collection file (postman_collection.json) into Postman.

2. Use the collection to interact with the API endpoints for master details CRUD operations.

3. Generate JWT tokens using the relevant authentication endpoint, and include the token in the Authorization header for secured requests.
